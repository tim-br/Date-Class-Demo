# Date-Class-Demo
A quick demo of a date class in c++.

I wanted to demonstrate a simple C++ class with minimal code.

To run this, just compile Main.cpp and run the executable.

The Date.h file is the header file for Date.cpp.

Date.cpp contains the Date class.

Main.cpp contains a main function that performs a quice demo.
